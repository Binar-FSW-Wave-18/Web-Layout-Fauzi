            Git is a free and open source distributed
            <em>version control system</em> designed to handle everything from
            small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
          </p>

          <p>
            Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast
            performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce,
            and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient
            staging areas, and multiple workflows.
          </p>

          <h3>What is Git?</h3>
          <p>
            By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the
            world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source
            project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous
            creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of
            software projects rely on Git for version control, including
            commercial projects as well as open source.
          </p>
          <p>
            Git is software that runs locally. Your files and their history are
            stored on your computer. Having a centrally located place where you
            can upload your changes and download changes from others, enable you
            to collaborate more easily with other developers
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point in any software project, you will need to share your
            code with other developers. If you‚Äôre using Git for source control,
            there are three primary options:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li class="first-li">Github</li>
            <li>Gitlab</li>
            <li>Bitbucket</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            You can learn more at
            <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git Docs</a>.
          </p>

          <h3>Why should you learn Git?</h3>

          <p>
            As software developers, whether you are hoping to build the next
            thing that will change the course of history or you just want to
            know enough to make ends meet, chances are you will not do this
            alone which means you need others to actualize that dream. If you
            fall anywhere within this wide spectrum then you need to learn git
            as soon as possible.
          </p>

            <li class="first-li">
              Git is the most popular distributed version control system
